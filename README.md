# <h1 align="center">⚡ Hi. I'm Javier Gómez ⚡</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">I am a 29 year old boy living in Madrid who loves to spend as much time as possible outside the big cities.

I started my professional career as a motorbike mechanic in a small workshop in Arganda del Rey(Madrid), specifically in [Classicco](http://www.classicco.biz/).

There I was able to grow professionally until I found the limits that my own work put on me. It was there, in [Classicco](http://www.classicco.biz/),, that I realised that a comfortable job was not for me, I needed something that would give me continuous challenges, something where I would not stop growing, where continuous training was the order of the day. And after some time thinking and talking with friends from the world, I asked myself, "Why don't you try development?
